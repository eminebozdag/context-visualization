# Context Visualization

## Overview

ðŸ”— First you can examine the project in [live](https://context-visualization-eminebozdag.vercel.app/).

If you're new to [Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html), **context-visualization** is prepared for you to visualize React's Context structure. You can use it as functionally as you want later, but for now I'm keeping it as simple as possible so you can easily understand the logic.
